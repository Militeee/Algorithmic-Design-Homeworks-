## Homeworks for the algorithmic design course 

 If there are no readme in the subfolder just type make all from here (or the subfolder) and run main.x in the subfolder

The comments are in the source files and not in the headers, supposing that one has to read also the implementation I decided to put all in one place

Where there is no unit of measure, time is taken in seconds

DONE:

- memory leaks control
- comments
- RedBlack Tree

TODO:

- final bug check for special cases

List of topics:

- Homework_1 = (c) Memory (more) efficient Strassen Alghoritm for matrix multiplication
- Homework_2 = (c) Chain Matrix multiplication, best parenthesization 
- Homework_3_5 = (c) Various searching algorithm + selection algorithm
- Homework_4 = (c) min binary heap implementation usign array
- Homework_6 = (c++) Red Black Tree and Binary tree implementation
- Homework_7 = (c++) Dijkstra algorithm, both with array and binary heap as queue
