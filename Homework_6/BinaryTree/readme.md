# Milite and Scassola c++ exam
- `Scassola_Milite_Report`: report about this project.
- `Makefile`: this will produce the executables `bench` and `unitTest`.
- `bench`: Binary Tree benchmark: the two arguments you pass to the exectuable are respectively the size of the linked-list tree and the size of the other trees (ex: ./bench 10000 10000000). We kept them separated since the first benchmark is much slower for the same tree size. The source code is in `benchmark/Performance_test.cpp`.
- `unitTest`: unit test for verifying the program correctness.
- `include`: this folder contains the Binary Tree source code.
- `test`: this folder contains the unit test source code.
- `documentation`: 
- `html`:
- `old`: this folder contains just and old not recursive version of the Binary Tree.
